................................................31.31-Day-15_Grub_BootLoader.............................................

NOTE:bootloader will call the kernal

bootloader is two stage :

1-frist stage is 446byte located in MPR

2-second stage located in /boot/ 

-------------
linux bootloader is called Grub or Grub2 in RHEL7

NOTE: Grub contains in conf-file menuo entry wich is an selection appers in booting the machin from wich we can deside to bootup operating system (linux or windos or mac)

NOTE :any operating system can have more than one kernal as we have mach vergens of kernal 

so we can boot from any kernal we have installed
 

-NOTE : each kernal can have its menuo entry 

-NOTE: each kernal have its (initramfs) that contains moduls and drivers

-------------------------
NOTE :Grub start befor the kernal and name the disks onther names like (hd0 , hd1 ,hd2)

and it name the partitions as like (msdos1 , msdos2 , msdos3)

if we have disk contains MPR and 3 partitions its nams by grub be like 

      ⬇from kernal           ⬇️from Grub

for   sda1        ->        hd0,msdos1

for   sda2        ->        hd0,msdos2

if its gpt not mpr it will be hd0,gpt1
----------------------------------
 differenc bet MPR and gpt

MPR : located in the frist of the disk partion and 512 byte and allow to have 4 primary partition ,partition taple is 64byte

so if mpr coraptted the partitions will corrabte too

-each block has address of 32 bit only so each block contains 2 power 32 and each sector is 512 byte so we will have 2 tera byte allowed limite
so if we have disk has large space than 2tera byte mpr wont read all of it


GPT : 

|-allow (128)partitions

search in google 

good zan mpr

NOTE: 

MPR == LBA == msdos

GPT == GUID
       EFI (extensable firmware interface)
      UEFI (universal extendable firmware interface)
---------------------------------------------------
 
to return evrey thing agian if we corrapt grub conf-file we can use command :

grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

NOTE: note the name of grub file some times it chang


if we reinstall grub or another version of it it will override the conf-file 
end of that file
