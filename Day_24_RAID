RAID :Redundant Array of independant Disks 

-its an additional disks in the server to avoid lossing data if the peminant disk has corrated

-its used to be an backup disk 

-so developers decided to add an disk to the main disk any thing written in the main disk will be written in the second disk too

-if the frist failled the second will work insted of the frist one that has corrabted


------------------------------------------

-Redundent : means that data will be written more than one time

-array : list of disks

-independant : means not related to the main disks



so (RAID) : means we have a list of separated disks to make redundancy of data 
--------------------------------------------------
 fristly we make Hard Ware RAID (RAID controller) that hardware card 


-is used to connect the RAID disks to the device 
-so we hve to configer the RAID controller to determine how many times we want to write copies of the data
if we have 3 disks so we configure it to writ data three times on the disks



-the load of writing data is on the card not on the operating system

NOTE :each disk has its own speed of writing data 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:the RAID controller has (fast speed cach ) in this we write data speedly befor writing it in the RAID disks

it is 12Giga size or lower than it

-NOTE: RAID controller has its battery to not down if electrcty gone to save the data and write it after that


-----------------

-NOTE: each RAID controller has its own nmber og disks that can support 


so if we have server of 6 disks and controller of 4 disks 
we will add another controller to suport the other two disks

so now we know that servers can support more than one RAID controller cards


---------------------------------

if we have two controller of 4 diskes suported for each card 

we can not compine disks into an array of 
disks from the two cards the disks must be on the same controller.

as each one has its own cash separated 
-------------------------------------------
-as the hw controller are expensive :

we developed an software RAID controller

but note like hardware as no battery no cach.

Redundant Array Indebendant disks : Hard ware RAID

Redundant Array inexpensive disks : software RAID
