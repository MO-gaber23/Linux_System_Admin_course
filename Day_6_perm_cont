WNote :


when using symbols to chang permission like u g o with rwx


this method is :sympolic method


ther is another method called numerical method :


we assigne valuse to the sympoles to use insted:

r = 4

w = 2

x = 1


the full numper of rwx is :7


note that rw = 4 + 2 = 6
          rx = 4 + 1 = 5
          
so we cant conflect between it


if we have file its perm:

rw-r--r--
6 -4--4--


to change permissions with numrical :

command:

chmod  Numper for user group other

chmod 7 mana
it will make user have rwx perm

chmod 64 mana

it will make user have rw group r 


chmod 400 mana

user have r group have no perm other have no perm


setting permissions :



command chmod ug=rw,o=rx file1

it will set that permissions only


Note ; in numeric we must detemine the perm of user and group and others in the command 

but we can in sympolic




.........................................................................................


command :
chmod a=r file1

a :for all user group other

-rw-r--r--  1 root root 2735 Mar 18 19:26 ubunto
