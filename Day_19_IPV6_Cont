.......................39.39-Day-19_IPV6_Cont..................


NOTE : we have three ways to have ipv4 address 

1- manualy -> static ip 

2- Auto  by -> DHCP

3- by APIPA -> 169.254.xx to some users connected by switche to communicate 

named (zero conf)
---

NOTE: in ipv6 link-local == APIPA in ipv4 

 creat Eui(Extended uniq identifire) by using the mac address of the device
its 64 bit 

Eui created by adding fffe at the middle of mac address 



link-local created by adding fe80: at the frist of Eui and add zeros 


and continue like the last video


----this methodes work in linux and cisco 
not work in windows as it generate random ipv6

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: IPV6 work with multicast not broadcast


multicast in ipv4 start with 224.0.0.0 end with 239.255.255.255

we must know that ps dont lesten to multicast come from routers as router maks multicast to news other routers that its ther 

but if we send backets on ip 224.0.0.1 any one in network can see it but any other ip like 224.0.0.2/3/4 debend on the protocol 

this help us in netowrk discovery by sending backets to ip 224.0.0.1
-------------------
in IPV6 multicast is any ipv6 start with (ff00:)

we can do network disvovry in ipv6 by using ip ff02::1 when we send to this ip all hosts in our network will resbons to you
---------------------

private ip in ipv4

10.0.0.0/8  so it start from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0/16

192.168.0.0/16

-we use this ip's for local netowrk devices as in local network hostes can tak this aipes an it will be repeted in another network 

but each network has publec ip in the interface of its router conected to the internet 

so local network devices can communicat with privates ip with each other but communicate with the outer networks and enternet with public ip in the router inter face card 

the method of this called (NATING)

NAT is to have bublic ip and privet ip and communicat with the two of it in different nwtworks   

--------------------------------

-in IPV6 multicast can pass throughuot routers in our network but don't go to enternet 


by using site local as if we send backets to ipv6 start with fd00::/8

it will make sitelocal multicast 


so if we have two switches connected by router and each swithe has his hostes and some host send backets to fd00::/8 it will multi cast to all hostes in this network and bass throughout the router to the other switch hostes
---------------------

in IPV6  we dont use dhcp to has our ip 

to come with ip the host will send backets (SLAAC Discovery ) to searche about router and router will resbonds with his ip and name-server for the dns as we must know it to up in internet

the host will take its subnet and use supnet+Eui
