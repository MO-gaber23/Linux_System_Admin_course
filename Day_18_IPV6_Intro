we can kwno the status of our interface use :

command : mii-tool interface-name

command : ethtool interface-name

IPV6


ipv4 was 32 bit 

-for broadcast 255.255.255.255 cuse broadcast storm in switches it fail the network with large size files's backets  

SO WE have 4 belion ip address

it partionized into groubs A B C D

and it is not enough now so we come with IPV6

-no of ip was small

---
ipv6 have 128bit

-its larg ip addres so we have large large number of ip's we can't use all of it 

- it solve the broadcast problems as it use mlticast insted of broadcast so not all devices in the same switch get the same masege


- unicast maks device sends backets from the sender device into one device (reciver only)
so each device to connect to server must initiat its connection 
 but it has a problem : 
if we have 4 users send requestes to server and each user work with 3megabit/sec

and server work with 10megabit/sec 

we see that to send data to the all four users we must has server with 12megabit/sec

so it case fail in sending data eficantly.

the solution is to let the routers and switches decide how many user needs data in the network as the server send one copy of the data to switche connected and the swithe 

connected to two routers the two has requested that data so switch will make acopy for the two routers and each router will deside how many copies will make depinding on the number of requstes it have from its network 

so at the end of network if we have switche taks backes od data from router and must make many copies for its user connected with it can has overload and trafic didnt go to users 

this is multicusting

but not all the network from all routers and switches till that switch 

-NOTE : all user must request the same data in the same time like streeming in cctv ,iptv

-NOTE : multicast deal with realtime cams

----------------
NOTE : in switches the hardware optimized to seds packets of data from interface to another interface so it can overload

-routers depend on software to forward backets from network to another network
-------------------------------
-we use unicast in defferent data requests

------------------------------
broadcast : uses ip 255.255.255.255

to sed data to all users in the same network with switche 

- if abroadcast arived to router -> router drops it as multicust 
but we can enable multicust to not droped



-broadcast in switche converted into phisical address as switche work with phisical address in communication 

so 255.255.255.255 converted into -> ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

 to overcome broadcast storm we have to make broadcast conrol in the switche 






------ 



NOTE : ther are no broadcast in IPV6

-IPV6 : work with hexadecimal with 8 nodes xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
 
where x can be from 0 to F
