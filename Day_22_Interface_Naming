......................................45.45-Day-22_Interface_Naming......................................................


in any server we have an port for ssh connection to allow us to controle  and monotring the server remotly 
from web like remote disktob in windows 

-we can configur the storage in that server 

-we can reboot it and power on or power off

------
some problem to solve:

in servers we have 4 ports ethernet for VM and 2 fiber to access the storage


and 2pors built in to access the operating system  


----now we have 8 ports the khazok is witch one will be readen fristly

witch will be eth0 and eth1 and so

the operating system will do unexpected naming

so if we have ports eth0 and eth1 and so in os debian 

if we change to red hat may port eth0 become eth7 and so with the other ones

so that is the unexpected naming.

so to solve that problem we go to the data center and change the cables but its nonusfull if we have large no of server 


-:the real solution is the interface naming protocol

that debend on where the port name in the (PIOS) 

as pios will fristly in pooting the machine will search for the interfaces and name it 

we have two types of interfaces :

1- on poard (bult in cards)

will named as eno + numper pios read (ethernet on-board)



2- external cards connected with bci

will named as ens +  number if we have one port only

if we have more than one port in the external interface :

we will name it like ens +number +p (portnumber)

like (ens1p0) 
 
----------------------------------------------

to list all ports we have and interfaces :

command: lspci | grep -i ether


┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/mo]
└─# lspci | grep -i ether
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: VMware VMXNET3 Ethernet Controller (rev 01)
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: VMware VMXNET3 Ethernet Controller (rev 01)
0c:00.0 Ethernet controller: VMware VMXNET3 Ethernet Controller (rev 01)
13:00.0 Ethernet controller: VMware VMXNET3 Ethernet Controller (rev 01)
1b:00.0 Ethernet controller: VMware VMXNET3 Ethernet Controller (rev 01)



-------------------------

we have backage named (biosdevname ) used in making kernal see the names of interfaces comming from bios and make apply to it.

---------------------------------

to return to naming like eth0 we must lock biosdwvname in booting the machin:

1- when the machine is booting and menu entry appers click e 

2- go to line linux16

3- at the end of line linux16 add (biosdevname=0 net.ifnames=0)


------------------------------------------------------

 to stop and disable NetworkManager :

systemctl stop NetworkManager.servece

systemctl disable NetworkManager

systemctl start network

systemctl enable network
