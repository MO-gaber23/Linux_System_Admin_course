we have three main permission to :

1- the owner of the file who created it 

2- the group that the owner in so any user in that group have thhe same permission like the owner

3- other users 


the three main permissions is :
read   write  execute
 r       w      x




whne we listing file in directory py command: ls -l
it appere like that 

drwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Feb 17 17:04 fluxion


the d in the frist refer to directory
if it was:
- it reffer to normal file 
d directory
b block device :like disk/partion so its the device the system write and read from block by block
c char dev    :like keyboard terminal ////////////character by character
l linked file : shortcut
 
then the permission comes for 


fil or dir or link    owner-perm    group-perm     others-perm     link_counter     owner   group      size         date of last access             Name
d                       rwxr         -xr          -x               13               root    root       4096       Feb 17 17:04                      fluxion

link_counter :refer to how many shortcut for that file hoe many likes of theat file


after the permissions we see dot . that refer to selinux to protect that file or directory








note that whne permission not given it comes with dash 
insted of the permission leter

Note/// it need 10 bits for the permissions leters and kind of the file 
 







in command we refer to the users by the given leters:

u : for usre or owner

g : for group

o : for other


so we can shange permissions for owner group other by:
command : chmod  u or g or o  +  r or w or x file name


for file  help.txt
we change modes of the others and groups by commands:


 chmod o+wx help.txt/     :that change mode of others to write permission

- rw- r--  rwx 13 root root 4096 Feb 17 17:04 help.txt

command :

 chmod g+rwx help.txt

- rw- rwx rwx  1 medo medo 2435 Mar 10 22:16 help.txt

we can change permission for u g o in the same time by commanf
chmod ugo+rwx file name 

Note :
to remove permission from u g o insted of useng + use -

chmod u-r name file 

that command make the user cant read that file



.................................

we can add and remove permission in the same time in on command


command: chmod ug+r , o-wx fileName

if i didnt determined wich i will add or remove perm it wil add or remove from the all

chmod -r file name
 
chmod -r mana
it give:
d-wx--x--x 10 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 mana

chmod +r mana
it give:
drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 mana






Note : to add perm to u g o and remove from the others :
command 
chmod -rwx,o+rwx mana
it gives:

drwx------ 10 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 mana









to applay changes to the sup files dir in one command us option : -R with the command chmod


command :
chmod -R  g+w mana
it gaves :
d---r----- 10 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 mana
and all files dir in will chnged modes too
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 apache
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Feb 18 10:29 crackapd

=========================================================
to change the owneer chip of dir or file use command:
command:
chown userName fileName

to change group own 
chown username:groupname file naem

i can change the owner group too :
command:
chown username:groupname filename
or
chown :groupname filename
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
if iam a user not in the ownergroup or not the owner of an file 
so i have no perm to it put 
we cann use ther is an special perm named :set user id bit :


its allow me to have fun with files only related to me but iam not its owner 


like file /etc/shadow iam not the owner to thes file or in shadow group but i can edit my passwrd on it only

as it have the set user id perm
so i can idet it for me not for any user els 
⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️

to give that permission (ser user id ):

the file must had exicute permission befor giveing him the set user id

command:

chmod u+xs file1
dr-sr--r--  2 root Net1 4096 Mar 23 17:38 file1

now the file named file1 have the set user id permission
its like the owner permission
.......
if it wasnot exicutable file it will gave (S) like: 
  ⬇️ 
d r-Sr--r--  2 root Net1 4096 Mar 23 17:38 file1
.............................................................


in numarical for set user id add the furth number :

4 to setuser id 

command:
chmod 7774 file1

............................................................

like set user id we have set group id but for the groups 

to be the groupowners but for the system only not have the privelege of that ownergroup in onther files


command :
chmod g+xs file1
      ⬇️
dr-sr-sr--  2 Gaber Gaber 4096 Mar 23 17:38 file1

 
when setting roup id on directory it make any file will created in be in the group owner of the dir

............................................................................................................


stikybit :

it give perm to read write in dir files but cant delet from it
 when you are not the owner
like tmp dir we can read its files write files on but cannot delet from it



command:

chmod o+xt file1
         ⬇️
